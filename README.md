My notes on learning VIM from some people at work.

I've mainly been an IDE guy.  VIM is just something I've used when managing config files on a linux server.  I see a lot of people these days using VIM for their primary text editor when writing software.  I'm open minded, let's give it a try!

Step 1 - The Basics
===================
Get a cheatsheet and practice it!  Forcing myself to edit files with VIM throughout the day.  Get used to using h,j,k,l to move around.  [This quick reference sheet](http://www.digilife.be/quickreferences/QRC/vi%20Quick%20Reference.pdf "VI Quick Reference")  has the basics and doesn't hit you with too much at once.  

Step 2 - Navigating the Project
===============================
The thing that became immediately apparent to me was that it was difficult to move around the project efficiently.  This is where I was introduced to ctags and CtrlP.  Ctags are basically a way of indexing your source code, and CtrlP is a plugin that enhances VIM's builtin fuzzy search.  Here is a great writeup on the whole thing: [VIM Source Code Navigation](https://github.com/dapplebeforedawn/ides-considered-harmful-talk/blob/master/source-navigation.markdown)
